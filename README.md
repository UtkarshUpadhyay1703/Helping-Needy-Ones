Vendors get information on our website about tenders.
The tender is released automatically on the 1st day of the month when the amount obtained through donation has fulfilled the minimum amount needed for the tender to be released.
After the tender is released, the vendor can see the information about the tender on our website and can bid for the tender after login.

Now, after the bidding process, the top 5 contenders will be shortlisted automatically and our employee physically visits the 5 contenders and tests the quality with price, then the employee will select one vendor from which we will get the items.
Now the whole delivery will be received at our warehouse.

The employee will receive the delivery as per the details at the warehouse and update the status.
When any donor wants to donate any item, then, as he uploads the item details, then our employee gets a status for approval or hold. When the donor donates the item at our warehouse, then the employee receives the donated items and then he approves the request of the donator to then, automatically, a receipt is generated and sent via email.

The employee maintains the details about donated items, generates receipts, and also takes images of donated items with the person.
The database is maintained about how many donations happened till the date and how many people benefited from this process.

## Non-Functional Requirement:

### Transparency:
Our purpose is to make the website fully transparent so that everyone can know how many donations happen till the date.

### Culture:
This website also helps to regrow the emotions in a person and lets them know that by donating, one's life will be improved and also the donator feels good. This creates a culture of helping humans and it makes society a better place.

### Automation:
When the donor donates the item, he/she will get an e-receipt in their mail. Vendors get order details either through email or a message from the employee. When the vendor delivers the items, the employee has to submit the form, and then automatic payment will be made.

### Helping:
When we help the needy, it gives them moral support, and showing heartfelt humility and respect makes them aware that someone really cares about them and is trying to improve their condition and fulfill one of the necessities of life: Roti, Kapada aur Makan. Helping people who are in need gives them the inner piece. It will boost our self-esteem. Our motto is not only to help the needy people, but also to help the local vendors improve their business and expand their business.

### Availability:
We just created our website. If any person wants to donate money, then he/she can donate at any time throughout the year.
So that there is no time boundary and whichever time the donor feels comfortable, he/she can donate the money.

### Money Management:
When the person donates the money monthly, it gives the donor a sense of responsibility. Also, by donating the money monthly, the donor knows how to manage money and take out some for the donation. It also improves the person's money management.

### Give, If You Can’t give time:
When you’re too busy or not able to donate your time, giving money is the perfect workaround. Never think that you can’t improve someone’s life or the world itself if your personal or professional schedule won’t allow the time.
